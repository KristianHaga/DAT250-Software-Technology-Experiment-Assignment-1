# Assignment 7

## Technical Difficulties

No technical problems, installation worked very well using homebrew on mac OS. There were however a few small things here and there that didn't always work like in the tutorial at first. I ended up using maven, after struggling a bit with the classpaths and different JAR files. No pending issues
