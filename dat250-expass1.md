## Installation

Unusally few technical problems. I struggled a bit with understanding how to properly install and set up maven on Mac OS. 
I found that this could be easily done using homebrew. A quick `brew install maven` command did the trick. 

## Heroku

I followed the tutorial, which made me test the software locally by installing the application with ´mvn clean install´, and verifying the application by opening the browser on localhost to see if the application was running.

Additionally i pushed my application to the heroku git server, which made me able to run the application and visit the applications url to confirm that it was running as planned. 

No technical difficulties regarding Heroku. 

I completed the whole tutorial, no remaining tasks that i didn't get done.
