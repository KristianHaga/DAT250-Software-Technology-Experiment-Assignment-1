# Assignment 4

## Overview

I cut this assignment down a bit, due to approaching deadlines in other courses. I skipped the optional exercises 3 and 4. I will come back to solve them when i have the time.

Exercise 1 went very smoothly, tested the `GET` and `PUT` requests using Postman.  

In exercise 2 i used the template for jpa-basic from Assignment 2. I added the Spark functionality and made implementations for the `GET`, `PUT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` requests. The `GET` requests can be made using a specific ID or without ID to return all the objets.

## Technical Difficulties

No technical difficulties this assignment.
